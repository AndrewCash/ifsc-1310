        <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Enhancement</h2>
        <p>
            When the world wide web was origionally invented, it was made with the intent to serve information to many different people from many different places. Web browsers were much simpler in their first incarnation. They simply printed lines of text without
            much styling or dynamic changes. Web pages were just static information.
        </p>
        <p>
            As fancier, more complex browsers were made, new features were added that changed how users viewed and interacted with content on the web. Websites were created in such a way that attempted to push the bounds of the web and utilize as many new features
            as they could.
        </p>
        <p>
            A problem began to emerge. Not everyone using these websites were using the latest and greatest web browsers for a multitude of reasons.
            <ul>
                <li>Perhaps the user might be on a company computer that uses only a specific, older version of a browesr that the IT department has deemed trustworthy.</li>
                <li>Perhaps the user is on a mobile device.</li>
                <li>Perhaps the user is using text only mode on a CLI browser.</li>
                <li>Perhaps the user is browing with javascript turned off.</li>
                <li>Perhaps the user is seeing or hearing impared.</li>
                <li>Perhaps the user might not even be a human at all, but a web crawler program indexing websites for a search engine.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            This could lead to a poor, disjointed user experience and make it more difficult for users to find the information they were looking for in the first place.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where Progressive Enhancement could come into play.
        </p>
        <p>
            With Progressive Enhancement each part of the webpage serves a specific purpose. The HTML of a page should only serve the markup of the text content a page is intended to show. It should not concern itself with how it will be presented or dynamically
            displaying content.
        </p>
        <p>
            CSS files can take care of the styling and JS files can take care of dynamic functionalty. Developers should stray away from inline styles or scripts. They should make sure that the content is avaliable first before the page does anything fancy using
            techniques and features that might not be avaliable to every user.
        </p>

        <p>
            I also learned a few things when working on the Dragon assignment. The main complaint made when I asked people about the website was that it was a little hard to read the text with the given font size. That was easily fixable.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also would have made the website differently to make it more mobile friendly. Since most of the people I sent the link to most likely opened it up on their phones. I don't think I would have to complelely start over but just retrace a few steps.
